# Programming Club Translator

This will be a project to provide quick translations for uncommon things.
First I will be writting a English to Morse Code translation.
Other ideas would be English to piglatin,  English to a self created language,
English to a cryptic language.
At first the code probably won't be very pretty, but over time I'll try to keep it organized and
semi-fast.
